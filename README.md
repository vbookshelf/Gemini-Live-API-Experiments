## Notes

1- It appears that chat context memory is enabled by default - the llm remembers past conversation turns.<br>
2- Installing PyAudio on a mac is not easy.<br>
3- On the free plan it looks like only a specified number of conversation turns are allowed. The connection is then terminated.<br>
